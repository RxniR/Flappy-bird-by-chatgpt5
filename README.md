## 🎮 Gameplay

Tap, click, or press **Space / Up Arrow** to flap your bird’s wings and navigate through endless pipes.  
Pass through gaps to score points — hit a pipe or the ground, and it’s game over.  

The game features:

- Smooth animation and physics
- Day/night cycle background
- Scaling to fit any screen size without squishing the bird
- Clean, responsive controls
- Best score tracking

## 🛠️ Cheats

Cheats can be activated by typing **numeric codes** into the on-screen cheat box during play.  
Cheats can be toggled on/off unless otherwise noted.

| Code  | Cheat Effect |
|-------|--------------|
| **4256** | **Invincibility** — Pass through pipes without dying *(still die to ground)* |
| **9001** | **Slow Motion** — Game runs at 60% normal speed |
| **1337** | **Easy Mode** — Bigger gaps between pipes |
| **7777** | **+10 Points** instantly added to your score |
| **0000** | **Clear Cheats** — Turns off all cheats, restores normal play |

> **Note:** There’s a short safety window after clearing cheats so you don’t instantly die if inside a pipe.

- **HUD Updates**: Displays active cheats during play.
